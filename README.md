## 1. Installation

## 2. Collecting Data

I used images from pyimagesearch by Adrian Rosebrock

## 3. Labelling Data
we have completed collecting images, now next step is Labelling the data. Labeling is the process of drawing bounding boxes around the objects.
LabelImg is the tool which I have used, LabelImg saves the image as xml file containing the label data for each image.

## Preparing data for training
